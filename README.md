# my-authorization-dotnet-template

> **Important:** Some logic in this template based on or taken from this [OpenIddict Samples repo](https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-samples). In the future, my project template will be refactored to completely rework the application logic and define the logic required for all authentication applications.

> **Important:** Docker does not trust the remote HTTPS certificates (with non localhost DNS) created by the PowerShell script in this repo
